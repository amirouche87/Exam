Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

-why do we need data structure?
Use of appropriate data structure enables a computer system to perform its task more efficiently


-What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?

Data update.insertion, retrieve

-List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
compiler Design,Operating System,Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis,Graphics,Artificial Intelligence,Simulation
-what is an Array?
an array is a table to store values
-what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
an array is limited and fixed length and arraylist is flexible,
-what is LinkedList?
it's just like an arraylist ,  It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
-How is an Array different from Linked List?
In array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value.
In case of a linkedlist, each node/element points to the next
-what is queue?
The Queue interface is available in java.util package and extends the Collection interface.
 The Queue is used to insert elements at the end of the queue and removes from the beginning of the queue
-what is stack?
 is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure.
 It supports two basic operations called push and pop
-what is FIFO and LIFO?
fifo"first in first out"
lifo"last in first out"
 are cost layering methods used to value the cost of goods sold and ending inventory.
-what is the order of complexity?
it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input,
-what is the best case to search an element from an array?
binary search, selection sort, insertion sort
-what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
heap sort and merge
-what is tree in data structure?
is a nonlinear data structure, and could be empty
-what is graph in data structure?
is a pictorial representation of a set of objects
-what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Hashtable is synchronized, HashMap is not.
 This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.
  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.
-What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
-How HashMap works in java?
when we call put method, hashcode() method of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a bucket location
 to store value object,
-What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
when we try to access an element of an array, with an index that is negative or more than the size of array itself.
-What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
we copy manually ,Arrays.copyOf() We can directly copy
-What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
 the link field holds the address of the next data item in the linked list.

-What is DFS and BFS?
The breadth first search (BFS) and
 the depth first search (DFS)
 are the two algorithms used for traversing and searching a node in a graph
-What is Recursion?
is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.
-What are linear and non linear data Structures?
linear data structure, the data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other.
 non-linear data structure involves multiple levels
-What is Big-(O)-notation?
is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
-Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
bubble,insertion,selection fast timing
merge sort is the slowest

-Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
