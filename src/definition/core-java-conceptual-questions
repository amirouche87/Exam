Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.Java Development Kit contains of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment

-java virtual machine:is the runtime engine of the Java Platform, which allows any program written in Java or other
language compiled into Java bytecode to run on any computer that has a native JVM.
-java runtime environment:it is a set of software tools for development of Java applications


What is IDE?
A.Integrated Development Environment) is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug
 Java programs


What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
 1-Eclipse
 2 – IntelliJ
 3 – Netbeans
 4 – BlueJ

-Explain the entire java life cycle.
- what is class? it is a template used to create object
-What is object?its a combination of data that has states and behaviors
-What is the entry point of an application? the main method
-Why main is static?s called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static
 it can be directly invoked via the class
-Which class is the superclass of all classes? object class
-What is  difference between path and classpath variables?
path is a variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path.
-What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?interface use implement , abstract use extend,
we can take multiple interface but we only can take one abstract, interface we don't include body, in the abstract we can
-Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ? no we cant  and we used
 by creating the body
-what is Access Specifier?Access specifiers are used to control the visibility of members like classes, variables and methods.
-What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.object oriented programing
-What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes.
the package imported by default is "package"
-What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK).
 It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces.

-does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
no it does not support multiple inheritance why : to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty.
-What is method overloading and when it happens?
using a method from a different class
feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name,

-Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
try and catch
it's an error that can happen during an execution
we handle it by cleaning up resources,chose specific exceptions,document the exception , try and catch
-What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the type
if you have a variable: private static int i = 0; and you increment it ( i++ ) in one instance,
the change will be reflected in all instances

-What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A class declared as final cannot be extended while a method declared as final
The final keyword can be placed either before or after the access specifier.

-What is final, finally and finalize?
Final class can't be inherited,method can't be overridden and variable value can't be changed.
 Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
  Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
-What is a constructor ?
it's a set of code that has the same name as the class and it's called when an object is created
-Can we have multiple constructors in a class? yes
-If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
constructor by default
-What is "this" keyword in java ?
used in a constructor, it refers to an object created
-What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
when we import a parent method overload from different class,
we can use it as many time as we can
-What is JVM stand for ?
abstract or virtual computing machine,
It interprets the compiled java code known as the byte code and helps in program execution depending upon the specific platform
-Is JVM platform independent?
it depends
What version of java are you using?
1.8
-What is JAR stand for ?
is a package file or archive  format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources
(text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.
-What is the difference between JDK and JRE?
JDK is a superset of JRE, and contains everything that is in JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers
 necessary for developing applets and applications.
 JRE provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applets and applications
 written in the Java programming language.

-What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
the JVM actually runs Java bytecode. JDK is Java Developer Kit, the JDK is what you need to compile Java source code,
 JRE is Java Runtime Environment, is what you need to run a Java program and contains a JVM,
 among other things. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.
-What is compile time and run time?
When an application is running, it is called runtime.
"compile time" are often used by programmers to refer to different types of errors
-What is heap?
its a sorting method
-How java manage it's memory?
The Java memory model used internally in the JVM divides memory between thread stacks and the heap
-What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable and you can't change it's value if you try to alter their values,
StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.
-What is Singleton class?
it has one object,pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.
-What is Serialization and Deserialization?
serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes
deserialization is The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes
-when to use transient variable in java?
When an object is transferred through the network, the object needs to be 'serialized'.
-Difference between while and do..while loop?
the differ in the order of execution,do while is executed in the end
-What is Enum?
 it is a special Java type used to define collections of constants
-What is Iterator?
is an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, we use it to read the arraylist and linkedlist
-Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer? int
-Why is String Immutable in Java?
class is simply a class whose instances and object cannot be modified
-What is constructor chaining in Java?
is a method of calling one constructor with the help of another
-The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one garbage collector
parallel collector uses multiple garbage collector
-What is JIT stands for?
just in time, stands for java virtual machine
-Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase
garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared,
-Can you guarantee the garbage collection process? no you can't
-What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
stack memory is used to store local variables and function call ,
while heap memory is used to store objects in Java
-What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
it is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods

-what is multithreading in java?
is to provide simultaneous execution of two or more parts of a program to maximum utilize the CPU time
-What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in Java guarantees that no two threads can execute a synchronized method which requires the same lock
 simultaneously or concurrently.
-What is Framework?
 are large bodies (usually many classes) of pre written code to which you add your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain.
-What are the testing Framework available in java?
selenium , testng,rest assured, mockito..
-Difference between jUnit and testNG?
the main difference is in the scoop , testNG is more advanced and for higher level testing

-What are the dependencies for this project?
Dependencies are the relationships of the preceding tasks to the succeeding tasks.
-what is dependency injection in java?
is a technique where by one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. ...
In Java, before we can use methods of other classes, we first need to create the object of that class
(i.e. class A needs to create an instance of class B).

-What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Static binding in Java occurs during compile time
while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
